# Expression Parsing

This is just a sort-of archive for a toy expression parser I made in the past with Python.

After running `main.py` you are prompted with a `> ` line. After entering a regular math expression and pressing enter, it should output the evaluated result that you would expect.

For example:
```
> (32 - 13) * 53 / 23 + 3
46
```

*Note: the output is 46 because of integer division*
